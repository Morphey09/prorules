    message: The use of the MD4 hashing algorithm was identified which is considered
      insecure. MD4 is not collision resistant and is therefore not suitable for
      cryptographic or secure use-cases. Use stronger algorithms such as SHA256,
      SHA512, or adaptive hashing algorithms such as argon2 or bcrypt.
