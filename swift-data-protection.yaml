    message: File storage was observed that does not leverage the platforms
      strongest available protection mechanisms. Where feasible, data should be
      stored with `completeFileProtection` or `completeUnlessOpen`, ensuring
      that data is sufficiently protected at rest. By default, data is unlocked
      the first time the user authenticates after boot.
