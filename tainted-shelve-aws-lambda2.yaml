    message: "The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
      can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can
      create a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take
      advantage of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service
      (DoS), Remote code execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. To
      prevent this vulnerability, leverage data formats such as JSON or XML as
      safer alternatives. If you need to deserialize user input in a specific
      format, consider digitally signing the data before serialization to
      prevent tampering. For more information, see: [Deserialization
      prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserializatio\
      n_Cheat_Sheet.html) The `shelve` module uses `pickle` and should not be
      used with data from untrusted sources."
