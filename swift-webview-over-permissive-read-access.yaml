    message: Webviews were observed to load content where the `allowingReadAccessTo`
      parameter is a directory, rather than a single file. If a single file is
      passed as a parameter, then only that single file is accessible, but
      passing a directory, is potentially over permissive. Consider whether this
      functionality is indeed required.
