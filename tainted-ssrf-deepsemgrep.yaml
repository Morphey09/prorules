    message: Untrusted input might be used to build an HTTP request, which can lead
      to a Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. SSRF allows an
      attacker to send crafted requests from the server side to other internal
      or external systems. SSRF can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
      data and, in some cases, allow the attacker to control applications or
      systems that trust the vulnerable service. To prevent this vulnerability,
      avoid allowing user input to craft the base request. Instead, treat it as
      part of the path or query parameter and encode it appropriately. When user
      input is necessary to prepare the HTTP request, perform strict input
      validation. Additionally, whenever possible, use allowlists to only
      interact with expected, trusted domains.
